## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Write about 1-2 paragraphs describing the purpose of your project.

<!-- ## üí≠ How it works <a name = "working"></a> -->

<!-- The bot first extracts the word from the comment and then fetches word definitions, part of speech, example and source from the Oxford Dictionary API.

If the word does not exist in the Oxford Dictionary, the Oxford API then returns a 404 response upon which the bot then tries to fetch results form the Urban Dictionary API.

The bot uses the Pushshift API to fetch comments, PRAW module to reply to comments and Heroku as a server.

The entire bot is written in Python 3.6 -->

<!-- ## üéà Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

To use the bot, type:

```
!dict word
```

The first part, i.e. "!dict" **is not** case sensitive.

The bot will then give you the Oxford Dictionary (or Urban Dictionary; if the word does not exist in the Oxford Dictionary) definition of the word as a comment reply.

### Example:

> !dict what is love

**Definition:**

Baby, dont hurt me~
Dont hurt me~ no more.

**Example:**

Dude1: Bruh, what is love?
Dude2: Baby, dont hurt me, dont hurt me- no more!
Dude1: dafuq?

**Source:** https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=what%20is%20love

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.


Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akwa749/P4P
```

Go to the project directory
```bash
cd my-project
```

Install dependencies
```bash
pip install open3d
```

Or alternatively,
creating (new) conda environment with required dependencies and versioning
```bash
conda env create -f env.yml
```

**Optional**: If you want to use an existing conda environment, update it with the required dependencies and versioning
```bash
conda env update --name [myenv] --file [local.yml] --prune
```
Note: `--prune` removes all other packages locally that is **NOT** in `[local.yml]`
